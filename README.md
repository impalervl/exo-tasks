## 4. A/B Testing Implementation

This implementation allows you to run A/B tests on promotional designs within your web application. 
It uses the `exads/ab-test-data` package to dynamically assign designs based on predefined split percentages and user cookies data.

### Features:
- Supports multiple promotions dynamically.
- Redirects users to different promotional designs based on a split percentage.
- Assigns designs consistently using user cookies.
- Provides a fallback promotion if no valid design is found.
- Option to ignore session tracking by clearing the assigned cookie.
- Can support multiple randomizers with possibility to store data in cache or DB.

### How it Works:
The A/B testing logic is integrated into the web applicationâ€™s request-handling flow.
The system reads user cookies to determine the design assigned to each user.
If no valid design is found for a user, a fallback promotion is provided.
Users can also clear their session to reset the assigned design or to switch to another promotion

- Navigate to promotions redirect page: `http://localhost:8099/promotion-designs/1`
- If promotion is valid user will be redirected to the ab-test page with design data in cookie `http://localhost:8099/ab-design-page`
- In case if user will navigate to `http://localhost:8099/ab-design-page` without cookie or with invalid cookie data user will be redirected to the fallback promotion `http://localhost:8099/promotion-designs/1` where design will be assigned and user will be redirected to the design page.
- If session support enabled user will always get assigned design until: clear cookie, session config will be turned off in server, user will be force assigned with different promotion through `http://localhost:8099/promotion-designs/1` link

### Main Code Locations:
- **Controllers:** `app/Controllers/ABTestDesignRedirectController.php; src/Controllers/GetABDesignPageController.php `
- **Logic Handler:** `app/Services/ABTest/ABTestService.php`
- **Configuration:** `config/ab-test.php`
